## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I feel like I'm getting better at doing stuff like this. Setting up a div, and centering it's items within it without over engineering the code. Also, this is the first time in a while I've used CSS variables based on a style guide and it feels like a nice workflow to just use the same variables over and over, rather than hex codes.

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  background-color: var(--color-yellow);
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 0;
}

#card {
  display: flex;
  width: 24rem;
  padding: var(--spacing-200);
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
  gap: var(--spacing-200);
  border-radius: 1.25rem;
  border: 1px solid var(--color-gray-950);
  background: var(--color-white);
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px #000;
}
```

### Continued development
I want to challenge myself to start using grid instead of flex for everything, just to test and strengthen my understanding of it.
